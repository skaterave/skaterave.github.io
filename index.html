<p>SkateRave is an RGB LED lighting board designed for roller skates, but can be used on so much more!</p>
<img src="1.jpg" width="100%">
<ul>
<li>Modes: 20 unique lighting modes, including solid colors and animations, that are toggled with the push of a button (and counting as we develop more!)</li>
<li>Battery Life: Runs on a 9v battery with ~25 days of continuous battery life (depending on the mode)</li>
<li>On/Off Swtich: No need to connect or disconnect the battery to control power; there is an onboard switch.</li>
<li>Mode Memory: Once you have selected your favorite mode, it will be remembered when turning it on and off. More time skating, less time fiddling.</li>
<li>Hackable: For the nerds in the room, this runs an Atmega328P-AU and has an exposed ICSP interface. Meaning, its totally customizable with the Arduino family of tools if one was so inclined!</li>
</ul>
<p>SkateRave boards are currently being built and a small batch will be available for purchase here soon.</p>
